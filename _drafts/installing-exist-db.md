Installing eXist-db is simple.  Just [download the installer](http://exist-db.org/), run it by double-clicking on the file once the download is complete, and follow the installer's prompts.  

The [eXist-db homepage](http://exist-db.org) has an article, [Getting Started](http://exist-db.org/exist/apps/doc/quickstart.xml), which does a great job leading you through the installation steps and is kept up to date as new versions are released.  

Also, the Getting Started video on the eXist-db.org homepage is also a great way to learn how to install the application. You can also access this video [directly via YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvMau2aHRDo#at=132).
