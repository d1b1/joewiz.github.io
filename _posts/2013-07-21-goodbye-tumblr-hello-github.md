I've moved my blog from [Tumblr](http://joewiz.tumblr.com) to [Github Pages](http://github.com/joewiz/joewiz.github.io), which uses an elegant static site generator called Jekyll.  While Tumblr is a great blogging platform, I found myself struggling with its markup tools, and began longing for a way to write in plain text - using Markdown, embeddable Github gists, good syntax highlighting, and versioning.  The more I read about Github Pages and Jekyll, the more I liked the system.  Jekyll also had a nice utility for importing Tumblr posts, and it mat even help me import my posts from the now-defunct posterous blogging service where I had posted a few articles.
