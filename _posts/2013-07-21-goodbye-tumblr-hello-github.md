I've moved my blog from [Tumblr](http://joewiz.tumblr.com) to [Github Pages](http://github.com/joewiz/joewiz.github.io), which uses an elegant static site generator called Jekyll.  While Tumblr is a great blogging platform, I found myself struggling with its markup tools, and began longing for a way to write in plain textâ€”using Markdown, embeddable Github gists, good syntax highlighting, and versioning.  The more I read and [heard](http://5by5.tv/webahead/54) about Github Pages and Jekyll, the more I liked the system.  Jekyll also had a nice utility for importing Tumblr posts; I may even be able to import my posts from the now-defunct Posterous blogging service where I had posted a few articles.  

I'm still getting situated here, so please check back.  The best way to keep up is to subscribe to this site's [feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/joewiz-org) using your feed reader of choice.  I'll also cross post new links on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/joewiz).
