I've moved my blog from Tumblr to Github Pages at [joewiz.github.io](joewiz.github.io). While Tumblr is a great blogging platform for prose, it's awful for posting code snippets.  I longed for a way to write my posts in Markdown and embed Github gists, with proper syntax highlighting for XQuery. The more I read about Github Pages and the Jekyll static page blogging platform, the more I liked it.  Jekyll also had a nice utility for importing Tumblr posts, and it mat even help me import my posts from the now-defunct posterous blogging service where I had posted a few articles.
