I've moved my blog from Tumblr to [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/), which uses an elegant site creation framework called called [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).  While Tumblr is a great blogging platform, I found myself struggling with its authoring tools, and began longing for a way to write in plain text that I could controlâ€”using Markdown, embeddable Github gists, good syntax highlighting, and versioning.  The more I read and [heard](http://5by5.tv/webahead/54) about Github Pages and Jekyll, the more I liked the system.  Jekyll also imported my Tumblr posts; I may even be able to import older articles from other services.  

I'm still getting situated here, so please check back.  The best way to keep up is to subscribe to this site's [feed](http://joewiz.org/atom.xml) using your feed reader of choice.  I'll also cross post new links on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/joewiz).
