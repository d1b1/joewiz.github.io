Some of the best writing happens in the moment. One downside of moving to Jekyll is that you leave the vibrant ecosystem of mobile blogging apps. Tumblr's app, for example, let me get thoughts down and post them right away, or edit old posts with ease. 

But mourn no more, Jekyll bloggers! [Octopage](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/octopage-blogging-jekyll-markdown/id649843345?mt=8) is an iPhone app that lets you edit and create new posts to your GitHub Pages-based Jekyll site. (Despite the Octo- prefix, it works fine with plain old Jekyll and doesn't presuppose Octopress.) Start the app, enter your GitHub credentials, select your GitHub Pages repository, and you're ready to begin editing existing posts or creating a new one. Octopage even prepopulates new posts with the requisite YAML front matter for Jekyll posts and has several settings for code block style and autocapitalization that create the right environment for your editing. Built in Markdown preview and syntax guide are nice touches for people like me who are still learning Markdown.

A few nits: I would prefer that Octopage offer OAuth authenication. Entering my username and password into an app feels so 2010. I encountered some display glitches that left me with only 2 lines visible. And a universal, iPad-aware edition would be great.

Ultimately, I hope more apps add native Github Pages and Jekyll publishing abilities.  We need a more vibrant ecosystem for Jekyll.  I really hope that the fantastic new [Editorial](http://www.imore.com/editorial-ipad-gets-thoroughly-reviewed-found-be-awesome) app for iPad will rise to the occasion and add these capabilities.

But for now, Octopage gets the job done and does so quite nicely. This entire post was written in Octopage with my left thumb while my daughter napped in my lap.
